              <div class="m2"><p id="hlo">Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic species for human consumption and use. Aquaculturists, or aquatic farmers, grow finfish, shellfish, aquatic plants, and other organisms. Seafood can be grown in rivers, the ocean (marine systems) in suspended cages, on vertical lines, along the ocean floor, or on land (recirculating systems) in tanks. Aquaculture is not a new practice, in fact, historians believe fish were cultivated in China as early as 2000-1000 BCE . Today, aquaculture provides over 50 percent of the world’s seafood supply, a figure which is expected to reach 63 percent by the year 2030</p>

<p id="hlo">provide a range of services to the aquaculture industry to ensure that the industry operates to the highest standards,In the areas of seafood safety, fish health and monitoring of the marine environment. We run a number of national aquaculture monitoring and control programmes to ensure that the aquaculture industry operates to international best practice standards, in accordance with European and national legislation, ensuring high quality seafood production and minimising the impact on the environment.
These programmes include the national sea lice monitoring and control programme, the national phytoplankton monitoring programme which monitors marine waters for harmful algal blooms, and the national residues programme. The Marine Institute is the regulator for fish health in aquaculture, and monitors shellfish for viral and bacterial contamination, and environmental pollutants.</p>
<p id="hlo">
We provide advice to the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine on the licensing of aquaculture operations. In doing this, we assess all relevant information, including all relevant Irish and international scientific research on aquaculture and its impacts, which includes sea lice impacts, seafloor impacts, environmental pollutants etc and assess all the environmental factors to arrive at a consensus on the potential impacts of an aquaculture development.</p>

    <h2>FAQ's</h2>
    <b id="neww">"Why not just eat wild fish?</b>
     <p id="hlo">Global wild fisheries production has remained stagnant since the late 1980s, and is expected
 to decline over the next decade due to overfishing. With a growing world population,"</p>
 <b id="neww">"Is farmed fish as healthy as wild?</b>
     <p id="hlo">Farmed seafood is safe and healthy to eat. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
    holds all seafood (domestic, imported, wild, and farmed) to the same food safety standards.</p>
    <b id="neww">Are farmed fish treated with antibiotics/growth hormones?</b>
    <p id="hlo">Diseases and parasites are naturally present in the ocean as well as lakes and rivers around the world.
        Aquatic farmers need to engage in proactive health management to prevent illness from spreading from the wild to farmed fish</p>
        <b id="neww">How much of Maine’s coastal waters is used for aquaculture?</b>  
        <p id="hlo">In 2018, there were 190 individual aquatic farms in Maine operated by lease holders, and 200 pre-revenue
            operations. The total number of acres of coastal waters designated for aquaculture in Maine grew</p>
